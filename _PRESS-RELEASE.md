There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Into the Wild

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Quickly get information on national parks and national forests in your area to get you out the door and off on an adventure!

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  In these times, it can be tricky to figure out ways to get out of your house and into the wild. This app brings together all the information you need to make informed decisions about when and where to get out and about in national parks across the USA.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Information regarding national parks and national forests are is currently not easily assembled in a way that one can quickly find what is available to them. This information is distributed across multiple web sites and sorted by states rather than presenting what's close by in an accessible format.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Into the Wild draws information regarding which parks exist nearby, park closures, camping availability, and much more together in one place to get you out the door and into the wild.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "We believe the importance of immersing people in the wonders of this coutry's national parks cannot be understated. Unfortunately, many folks don't know where to begin. Into the Wild makes these parks accessible to everyone."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  To get started, simply enter your location and be amazed at all the opportunities to find yourself heading out Into the Wild!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "With Covid-19 making it difficult for my family to take part in it's usual activites, we found ourselves in need of new adventures. Into the Wild has consistently delievered those adventures!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  Open the app, enter your location, and see what incredible wilderness is in your backyard!
